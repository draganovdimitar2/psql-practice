/* 
Create a view in SQL named "view_wizard_deposits_with_expiration_date_before_1983_08_17" that fetches data from the "wizard_deposits" table. 
The view should display the full name of the wizard, concatenated from their "first_name" and "last_name", 
along with the "deposit_start_date", "deposit_expiration_date", and "deposit_amount". 
The view's results should be grouped by the "wizard_name", "start_date", "expiration_date", and "amount". 
Additionally, the view should only include deposits that have an expiration date before or on '1983-08-17',
and should be ordered by the "expiration_date" in ascending order.
