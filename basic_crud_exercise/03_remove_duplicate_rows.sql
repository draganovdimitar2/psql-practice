-- As you can see, the "cities" table contains duplicate entries. Write an SQL query to retrieve DISTINCT city "name", sorting them in descending alphabetical order and eliminating duplicates. Do not forget to select the "area" column and keep the name of the column the same as in the previous task.


SELECT DISTINCT
	name,
	area AS area_km2
FROM
	cities
ORDER BY 
	name DESC;
