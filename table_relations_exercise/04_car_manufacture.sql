/* 
To complete this task, you will need to create a database called "car_manufacture_db" that consists of three tables: "manufacturers", "models", and "production_years".

a. Create Tables
The "manufacturers" table should have a column, which is "name". In the "models" table, you should include columns for "model_name" and "manufacturer_id". 
The "production_years" table should contain information about "established_on" and "manufacturer_id". You are free to select the data type for each column, 
but it is crucial to ensure that each column has a unique identifier. Additionally, it is important to correctly set up the foreign keys. 
Note that the "models" identifier should start at 1000 and increment by 1.
